1. Thanks for the purchase!

2. Some general information, I left notes in every folder in case you get lost :)

3. Ignore all compiler errors, they are from the third-party tools "Custom tree importer (CTI)". They generate at first import but everything should work fine, just clear them away. If you get pink previews just reimport all the prefabs.

5. In case you're using an older Unity version than 2020 down to 2017, the leaves on trees might appear as if they disappear with distance. It's just a bug with older versions so you'll have to import the 2018 leaf fix I put in the CTI folder from the "CTI_2017-2018-2019_RuntimeComponents" pack. There is a big chance the fix is already installed in this pack as it was recently updated so no need to find the fix anymore.

6. If "CTI wind from script" behaves strange, does not seem to work when you change the direction or strength of the wind, just delete it and add another wind zone with a new attached wind script! ("Terrain tree wind" only works with "wind from script").

7. Enjoy making the marvelous nature scenes of your creative mind!
---------------------

Version updates fixes:

- Rocky Hills Environment - Mega Pack V 4.0 

* Complete cosmetic change; remade textures
* Reduce file size and optimized textures
* Updated Amplify shaders (fixed bugs and screen NaNs)
* New "Toby foliage shaders" (TFS)

  - Grass Foliage shader 

       (Custom Amplify shader for grass): Physically-based lighting with translucency, simple wind, includes color variation, vertex Ao, and distance depth fade, supports mesh with custom normals. Wind and other parameters can be controlled globally through the (upcoming) wind script.

  - Tree bark and leaf shader

       (Custom Amplify shader for trees): Physically-based lighting with translucency, simple branch bending, wind, and leaf fluttering, supports trees with custom normals on leaves, includes color variation and vertex Ao. Wind and other parameters can be controlled globally through the (upcoming) wind script.

(At the moment the wind is controlled directly through the shader so you will have to match both values of the bark and leaves together.)

* New (TFS) demo scene for UPR and HDRP

*CTI Instructions*

Hi there and welcome to the Custom Tree Importer. 


Before starting please make sure that your project is set to use the linear color space in Edit -> Project Settings -> Player. 

In case your camera uses deferred rendering you also have to assign the CTI deferred lighting shaders in Edit -> Project Settings -> Graphics:
 Under the Built-in shader settings change Deferred to custom, then assign the CTI_Internal-DeferredShading shader. 
Also change Deferred Reflections to Custom and assign the CTI_Internal-DeferredReflections shader. 

In case you use Unity >= 5.6.0 you will have to enable instancing on each material manually. 

Please note: As the project contains shaders which support Unity 5.5 as well as Unity 2017.2 you may get a lot of shader warnings, just ignore them!
